# User Workflows

Besides the usual Cosmos SDK application functionality, Monomer applications must support two critical rollup-specific user workflows:

- Depositing assets from Ethereum to the rollup chain
- Withdrawing assets from the rollup chain to Ethereum

This section describes these workflows in moderate detail, with a focus on aspects that are unique to Monomer and the core components that enable them.

See https://specs.optimism.io/ for more detail on OP-stack user workflows.
